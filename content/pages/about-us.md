Alliance for Peace is a non-profit and nongovernmental organisation that holds an approved deductible gift recipient charity status (DGR). It was created in 2010 and is based in Newcastle, NSW.

It empowers war-torn communities by helping to reduce poverty and social marginalisation. Alliance for Peace strives to protect and advocate for refugees and prevent or solve conflicts that may arise in their resettlement to new countries.
