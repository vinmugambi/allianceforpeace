title: SHARE program
description: SHARE is a cultural exchange program aimed at integrating refugees with the resident communities
---

It is funded by the Newcastle City Council. It aims at bringing together different multi-cultural communities especially African refugees, Indigenous Australians, elderly Australians and Arabic communities to share their stories and experiences through dance, music and food. Communities share their cultural values. This project facilitates stronger communities and safer neighborhoods which can end isolation for many particularly the elderly. We provide free African food and we strengthen social cohesion and promote unity in diversity.
