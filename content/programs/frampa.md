FRAMPA is one of the programs initiated and administered by GAP. It aims to develop partnerships with the Australian rural community to assist African migrants and refugees to find employment and accommodation. Through various means, rural communities which can potentially offer employment, short or long term, and accommodation, are contacted and arrangements are made for the refugees and migrants to take up the offers. Various community organisations such as The Salvation Army, St Vincent de Paul and Rural Australia for Refugees (RAR) have also been contacted to assist in this program.

FRAMPA has been operating since 2010 and has placed families in farms in Tenterfield, Richmond, Mangrove and Cavan in NSW. Favourable comments have been received from the farmers and refugees with the refugees learning new skills and furthering their Australian experience. As has already happened in the placements mentioned above, these workers, and their families obtain paid employment and accommodation; reducing their dependence on Centrelink assistance.

The placements also offer the gaining of skills and experience which can enhance their chances of career related employment, the increase in English language skills and further opportunities to participate in local communities. In one rural area the placement of two families resulted in the re-opening of the local school. Some of these people have obtained permanent positions in other industries; eg. in factories in Richmond. NSW.

To help further the opportunities for refugees and migrants in rural areas FRAMPA is seeking to establish strategic partnerships with peak farming bodies, rural industries and communities, and groups such as RAR and Rotary etc.. With these partnerships FRAMPA will have current and ongoing information about employment opportunities and the rural communities will have up-to-date contact details of workers, currently available and willing to undertake employment in rural settings. (There are up to 200 refugees available as of Oct 2018)
