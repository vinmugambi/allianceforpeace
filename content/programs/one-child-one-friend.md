title: One child one friend
---

This project aims at linking Students from Australian Primary and Secondary schools with African Schools. Students become friends and get to know and help each another.
This programs involves the exchange of letters between schools in Africa and those in Newcastle and the Hunter region. These letters are translated from French, Swahili and Kinyamulenge languages to English and vice versa. Pen pals can lead to lifelong connections, friendships and learning about each otherâ€™s cultures.
